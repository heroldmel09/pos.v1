‚úÖ Step 1: Allow MySQL to listen on all interfaces

Find this part in [mysqld] section:

# bind-address="127.0.0.1" 
# bind-address = ::1          # for ipv6


Change it to:

bind-address = 0.0.0.0


This will allow MySQL to accept connections from any network interface (including your ZeroTier virtual adapter).

‚úÖ Step 2: Restart MySQL service

Since you‚Äôre using XAMPP, restart MySQL from the XAMPP Control Panel so the changes take effect.

‚úÖ Step 3: Create a user that can connect from ZeroTier

By default, root in XAMPP is restricted to localhost. You need to allow access for ZeroTier IPs (192.168.195.x range).

Run this in your MySQL console:

-- Replace 'yourpassword' with a strong password
CREATE USER 'root'@'192.168.195.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';

GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pos.* TO 'root'@'192.168.195.%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


This will allow any ZeroTier client with an IP in 192.168.195.* to log in as root.

‚úÖ Step 4: Update your Java connection

In your DatabaseConnection class, change:

String server = "192.168.195.57";  
String userName = "root";  
String password = "yourpassword";  // must match the password you set above




That '192.168.195.%' part is a host filter for MySQL. Here‚Äôs how it works:

'root'@'localhost' ‚Üí user can only connect from the same machine.

'root'@'192.168.195.57' ‚Üí user can only connect from that exact ZeroTier IP.

'root'@'192.168.195.%' ‚Üí user can connect from any IP in the 192.168.195.x range (your ZeroTier network).

So if your ZeroTier IP is 192.168.195.57, you can either:

Option 1 ‚Äì Allow only your device
CREATE USER 'root'@'192.168.195.57' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pos.* TO 'root'@'192.168.195.57';

Option 2 ‚Äì Allow any device in your ZeroTier network
CREATE USER 'root'@'192.168.195.%' IDENTIFIED BY 'yourpassword';
GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON pos.* TO 'root'@'192.168.195.%';


üëâ If this is just for you ‚Üí use Option 1 (more secure).
üëâ If you expect multiple clients (like other PCs on the same ZeroTier network) ‚Üí use Option 2.

‚ö†Ô∏è Don‚Äôt forget to run:

FLUSH PRIVILEGES;


Would you like me to also show you how to check which users MySQL already allows (so you don‚Äôt create duplicates)?
